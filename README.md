# older-nightwatch-generated-by-yo

Default code produced by Yeoman: http://yeoman.io/ and Joe Purdy's generator-nightwatchjs at https://github.com/joepurdy/generator-nightwatchjs.

Install Nightwatch from the Command Line: <i>npm install -g nightwatchjs</i>

Cannot run out of the box. Hasn't been updated in four years. More to compare scaffolding than anything.
